<p align="center">
  Since I started working, I noticed that itâ€™s beneficial dividing income into specific categories. I divided them into 'savings', 'daily expenses', and those related to 'entertainment'.
  This allowed me to manage my budget more effectively, and the savings I generated helped build a financial cushion. In the beginning, I did this on paper. 
  In fact, long before I started working, I would note my expenses on sheets of paper, which often got lost. That's why I decided to switch to electronic record-keeping. 
  I chose Excel spreadsheets for this purpose. However, I didn't really like it due to its clunky appearance and lack of functionalities I wanted.

  In the meantime, I decided to start designing my own application. It was supposed to automate the processes I previously had to calculate and manage manually.
  Additionally, I wanted it to be simple to use and include the functionalities I needed. The best part is that I can design and implement features myself. 
  Without much hesitation, I began creating this application.
